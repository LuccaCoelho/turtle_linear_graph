This is code 2. It is design to take 2 data sets with specific
values and create a line chart. It labels each data set names,
each point value, min and max of the 2 lines, and years for each 
value (starting in 1978 and increasing 10 years per value).

# Thoughts

# this is a giant code that I'm sure I did more than I should've. I took too long
# because was trying to prove myself that I can do something enjoyable and the way
# I thought was the best. This code can be changed by many ways, the data set could
# increase or decrease values, the data set color could change, etc. You could change
# all that by simply changing a list, and that's what I liked about this. It was extremely
# challanging and stressful, but I got to what I think is acceptable (not that I'm trying
# to be harsh on myself). My creative element is that no matter how long your data sets are,
# the screen will be always centering the graph and not having any values unseen.
